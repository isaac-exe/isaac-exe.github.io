        <h3>About</h3>
        <p class="about">
            Hey, I'm Isaac. <br /> <br />
            I'm a filmmaker, artist, and web developer based in my hometown Madison, WI, but I bounce between NYC and LA as well.
            I graduated from Carleton College in 2020 with a degree in Cinema and Media Studies,
            and am currently working at <a href="https://www.mortarr.com/">Mortarr</a> as a Frontend Developer.
            I also freelance as a producer and am coordinating photo shoots for <a href="https://www.citizenm.com/">
            CitizenM</a> at the moment.

            <br /> <br />

            You can take a look at my latest film, <a href="https://vimeo.com/395776985">Let the Good Times Bowl</a> on Vimeo.
            It's a short fiction narrative film that's inspired the American and French New Wave, The Big Lebwowski (1998),
            and the amazing people around me I call my friends.

            <br /> <br />

            In my free time I keep myself busy by writing screenplays, short stories, essays, and music related stuff
            for <a href="https://www.outsideindie.com/">Outside Indie</a>. I've been known to DJ and produce house music,
            and am working on directing and producing a screwball dark comedy releasing in December 2021. I also create
            and curate art in the NFT space, and am excited to tell everyone about a secret project I'm working on.

            <br /> <br />

            Right now I'm reading
            <a href="https://www.littlebrown.com/titles/david-foster-wallace/the-pale-king/9780316177931//">The Pale King </a>
            by David Foster Wallace, and have been listening to a lot of
            <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/2JFTRDi5v7JtqoouVe1z5D?si=etE2rt7vSCu8qW1bBwZfIg">Slow Pulp</a>, a band from Madison.
